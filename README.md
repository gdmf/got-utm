Tired of figuring out what UTM zone I'm in, so I wrote this. Work in progress.

To do:

- Figure out why coordinates entered into search box are are not zoomed to accurately
- fiddle with UTM zone styling
- attribution for UTM geojson
- try leaflet's unproject() method
- WGS84 <-> NAD83 conversion
- State Plane conversion?
